# 🎉 Sequential Numbering Feature - Successfully Added!

## ✅ **Feature Implementation Complete**

The Mass Contact Maker now includes the sequential numbering feature you requested, exactly like the previous version!

### 🆕 **New Naming Strategy Options:**

1. **📝 Column Data Mode** (Default)
   - Uses actual first/last names from your Excel/CSV file
   - Falls back to sequential numbering if no name columns are provided

2. **🔢 Sequential Numbering Mode** (NEW!)
   - Automatically numbers all contacts sequentially
   - Perfect for committee lists, group contacts, etc.
   - Format: `GroupName_1`, `GroupName_2`, `GroupName_3`, etc.

### 📋 **How to Use Sequential Numbering:**

1. **Upload your file** (Excel/CSV with phone numbers)
2. **Enter Group Name**: e.g., "ABC_Committee" 
3. **Select "Sequential Numbering"** radio button in the naming strategy section
4. **Select phone column** and other optional columns
5. **Generate VCF** - all contacts will be named:
   - ABC_Committee_1
   - ABC_Committee_2  
   - ABC_Committee_3
   - And so on...

### 🎯 **Perfect for Your Use Case:**

**Example Input:**
- Group Name: "ABC_Committee"
- CSV with 10 phone numbers

**Result:**
```
Contact 1: ABC_Committee_1 (Phone: +91xxxxxxxxxx)
Contact 2: ABC_Committee_2 (Phone: +91xxxxxxxxxx)
Contact 3: ABC_Committee_3 (Phone: +91xxxxxxxxxx)
...
Contact 10: ABC_Committee_10 (Phone: +91xxxxxxxxxx)
```
