# 🎉 Perfect! Mixed Naming Mode Added!

## ✅ **Exactly What You Requested**

I've added the **Mixed Mode** naming strategy that gives you exactly what you wanted:

### 🎯 **Mixed Mode Features:**
- **First Name**: Group name + sequential numbers (ABC_Committee_1, ABC_Committee_2, etc.)
- **Last Name**: Data from your selected last name column

## 📋 **How to Use Mixed Mode:**

1. **Upload your CSV/Excel file** (with phone numbers and last name column)
2. **Enter Group Name**: e.g., "ABC_Committee"
3. **Select "Mixed" naming strategy** (the new third option)
4. **Select Phone Column**: Choose your phone number column
5. **Select Last Name Column**: Choose the column with last names
6. **Generate VCF**: Get perfectly formatted contacts!

## 🎯 **Example Result:**

**Input:**
- Group Name: "ABC_Committee"
- CSV with Last Name column: "Smith", "Johnson", "Williams"

**Output Contacts:**
```
Contact 1:
  First Name: ABC_Committee_1
  Last Name: Smith
  Full Name: ABC_Committee_1 Smith

Contact 2:
  First Name: ABC_Committee_2  
  Last Name: Johnson
  Full Name: ABC_Committee_2 Johnson

Contact 3:
  First Name: ABC_Committee_3
  Last Name: Williams
  Full Name: ABC_Committee_3 Williams
```

## ✨ **Three Complete Naming Strategies:**

1. **Column Data**: Uses actual first/last names from your file
2. **Sequential Numbering**: Auto-numbers everything (ABC_Committee_1, ABC_Committee_2, etc.)
3. **Mixed Mode** ⭐ **NEW!**: Group + numbers as first names, column data as last names

## 🧪 **Test File Created:**

**`test_mixed_mode.csv`** - Perfect for testing the new mixed mode:
